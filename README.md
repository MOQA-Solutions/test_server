This is a simple server which offer the required TCP connection.<br>
**NOTE:**<br>
This is just for trying the client application, this is not a concurrent server and I have configured it
for just **one** connection at a time, if the connection fails, the server will automatically accept a new connection
after sleeping for 1 second for the garbage of the precedent exited server which have the same registered name.<br>
